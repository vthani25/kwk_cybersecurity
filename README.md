# Cyberthreats Dashboard

This project is a Tableau dashboard embedded on a website that shows global cybersecurity threats and their impact. It turns complex data about attacks like social engineering, weak passwords, unpatched software, and zero-day exploits into a format thatâ€™s easier to explore and understand.

## Purpose and Why I Made It

I created this dashboard during the Kode With Klossy Summer Program. Cybersecurity data can be difficult to read and interpret, so I wanted to make a simple, interactive way for students, organizations, and anyone interested to explore trends and see where cyber risks are highest. The goal was to combine visual storytelling with data analysis so that users can learn more about patterns in attacks and vulnerabilities.

## How I Built It

The dashboards were created in Tableau using interactive charts, maps, and filters. I used Kaggle to find my dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-cybersecurity-threats-2015-2024. I then embedded the completed dashboard into a website using simple HTML and CSS. This allowed viewers to explore the data without feeling overwhelmed and made the visualizations accessible on different screen sizes.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was embedding Tableau while keeping the dashboard responsive on the website. I learned how to structure dashboards clearly and integrate data visualizations into a website. In terms of the dashboard itself, it was difficult to find a good dataset and set up navigation through Tableau. This project overall also helped me practice thinking critically about how to present data in a way that tells a story, not just displays numbers.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to make the dashboard even more interactive to help users learn from the data and add additional cybersecurity resources to make it more educational(maybe even a blog)!
