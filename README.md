# 📈 Cyberthreats Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard embedded into a website that explores global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, their financial impact, and patterns in attack vectors. It turns complex cybersecurity data into an accessible, visual story that can be navigated and understood by a broad audience.

## 🌐 What the Project Does
The dashboard visualizes data on different types of cybersecurity vulnerabilities including social engineering, unpatched software, weak passwords, and zero-day exploits and connects them to **real world impacts**.  
Through interactive maps, charts, and filters, users can:
- Explore where cyberattacks have the most impact globally  
- Analyze which vulnerabilities are most common and costly  
- See how different attack types contribute to overall cyber risk  
- Navigate between dashboard sections to view specific aspects of the data

The Tableau dashboard is fully embedded in a responsive website, which provides contextual information and a smoother user experience than sharing Tableau alone.

## 💡 Why I Made It
Cybersecurity data can be dense and technical. I wanted to make it visually engaging and intuitive, so that students, organizations, and policymakers could quickly grasp patterns and insights. Embedding it into a website allowed me to pair the visuals with clear explanations and navigation, making the data tell a story.

## 🛠 How I Made It
- **Data Visualization:** Built entirely in Tableau, using multiple dashboard sheets, filters, and interactive buttons to create a cohesive flow.  
- **Design Principles:** Focused on clean layout, consistent color schemes, and data storytelling to guide users through insights step by step.  
- **Website Integration:** Wrote custom HTML and CSS to embed the Tableau visualization, style the page, and add sections like “About” and “Key Insights” for extra context.  
- **Deployment:** Hosted the site through GitHub Pages for easy public access.

## 📊 What I Learned
Working on this project strengthened my skills in:
- Designing layered Tableau dashboards that balance interactivity with clarity  
- Structuring data to support meaningful visual narratives  
- Embedding Tableau visualizations into a website and ensuring responsive display  
- Thinking critically about how to present insights, not just data

## 🚧 Challenges
One major challenge was making sure the navigation was clear for all users, and flowed correctly between the pages created by different team members. It was also a learning experience to figure out how to embed Tableau into a website and have it be responsive.
