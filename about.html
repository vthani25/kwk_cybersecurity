    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This website, CyberEd, was built to make cybersecurity education engaging and accessible. 
      It helps students and everyday users understand real-time cyber threats 
      and learn practical ways to stay safe online.
    </p>
    <h2>What the Project Does</h2>
    <p>
      We have visualized global cyber threat data and shows how attacks such as phishing, 
      malware, and data breaches occur. Through interactive dashboards and visuals, users can 
      explore how these threats work and discover how to prevent them.
    </p>
    <h2>Background & Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      CyberEd was developed during the Kode With Klossy Summer Program, inspired by a passion 
      for technology and a desire to raise cybersecurity awareness. This project combines 
      education and visualization to show how informed users can make the internet a safer place.
    </p>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      With millions of cyberattacks happening every day, understanding how and why data 
      is compromised has never been more important. CyberEd encourages users to learn about cyberthreats visually
      and discover the implications of their choices online.
    </p>
    <h2>About the Creator</h2>
    <p>
      Created by Thanishkka Vijayabaskar. I'm a student passionate about technology, 
      cybersecurity, and empowering others to use technology safely. This project grew from 
      real-world security concerns and a vision of building a more secure digital world.
